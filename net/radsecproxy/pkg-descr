radsecproxy - GUI

A user-interface for the configuration of radsecproxy,
a generic RADIUS proxy that in addition to usual RADIUS UDP
transport, also supports TLS (RadSec), as well as RADIUS
over TCP and DTLS. The aim is for the proxy to have
sufficient features to be flexible, while at the same time
to be small, efficient and easy to configure.
